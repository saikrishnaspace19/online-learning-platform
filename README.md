PROJECT OVERVIEW

ScholarStream is a cutting-edge, web-based Online Learning Platform designed to revolutionize the way students consume educational content. Developed during the CodTech IT Solutions internship, this application bridges the gap between static content and interactive learning. It mimics the sophisticated functionality of industry giants like Coursera or Udemy but is engineered with a modern, lightweight tech stack to ensure seamless performance and a premium user experience.

The primary objective was to build a student-friendly interface that prioritizes "Media Streaming," "User Authentication," and "Data Storage"—the three pillars of modern EdTech. The result is a robust "LMS Lite" (Learning Management System) perfect for hosting video courses, tracking student progress, and administering assessments.

Key Features
1. Immersive Video Learning Experience At the heart of ScholarStream is its custom video learning interface. Unlike standard video embeds, the player is wrapped in a cinematic container featuring gradient overlays and shadow effects to maintain user focus. The "Lesson Page" layout places the video front-and-center while providing a convenient sidebar navigation, allowing students to switch between lessons instantly without page reloads.

2. Integrated Assessment Engine Learning is reinforced through an Interactive Quiz System. Instructors can seamlessly intersperse video lessons with multiple-choice quizzes. The engine provides instant feedback—highlighting correct and incorrect answers in real-time—and calculates scores immediately. This mimics real-world certification workflows where progress is gated by knowledge checks.

3. Student Dashboard & Progress Tracking The Smart Dashboard serves as the student's command center. It visualizes data using dynamic metrics:

Course Progress: Visual progress bars show exactly how much of a course is completed.
Lesson Tracking: The system remembers which lessons have been finished using persistent local storage, ensuring data isn't lost on page refresh.
Certificate Status: Tracks eligibility for completion certificates.
4. Robust Authentication Simulation The platform features a secure-feeling Authentication Module. It implements full validation logic for Login and Signup flows, protected routes (guards), and session management. This structure is "backend-ready," designed to easily connect to a real API (Node.js/Firebase) in future iterations.

Technical Architecture
ScholarStream is built on the Modern React Ecosystem, prioritizing developer experience and application performance:

Frontend Framework: React 18 (powered by Vite) ensures lightning-fast performance and optimized build sizes.
Styling Engine: Tailwind CSS is used for a utility-first approach. We implemented a custom design system with semantic colors and modern UI patterns like Glassmorphism, rounded aesthetics, and micro-interactions to achieve a high-end feel.
State Management: A dual-layer approach using React Context API (AuthContext for user sessions and CourseContext for learning data). This eliminates prop-drilling and ensures the entire app stays in sync.
Data Persistence: Leveraging the browser's LocalStorage API to mimic database persistence, allowing users to close the browser and return to their exact state.
Conclusion
ScholarStream is more than just a website; it is a scalable, modular foundation for an EdTech product. By combining a beautiful interface with robust logic for tracking and assessment, it successfully meets the core requirements of modern media streaming and education platforms. This project demonstrates proficiency in frontend architecture, state management, and user-centric design.
